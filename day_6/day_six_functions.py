#Functions 
# Have already been using several functions already, such as print(), input(), and len().
#Functions bundle instructions together to avoid repetition and make code more readable.

def my_function(): #(def)ining the function
    print("Hello & Goodbye!") # this is the code that will run when the function is called, this code must be indented. 

my_function() # calling the function, which will run the code in the function

#test your code as you go, and do not wait till the end 

#indentation is highly important to know which block the code belongs to

#spaces vs tabs... python says spaces over tabs
