#While Loops

# For loops are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.

# for item in list_of_items:
#    Do something to each item

#for number in range(a,b):
#    print(number)

# While loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

# while something_is_true:
#    Do something repeatedly

# while not at_place():
#    Do something repeatedly

#When to use a while vs for loop. 
# For loops are great iterating over something, and doing something to eat item. Or for using a range of numbers.
# While loops are great for doing something until a condition is met.
