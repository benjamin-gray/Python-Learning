#for loops, range, code blocks

fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit) # loops through each fruit in the list then prints it to the console
    print(fruit + " Pie")
print(fruits) # prints the list of fruits after the for loop has finished because it is not indented
